# A Chinese-Java IDE 

### The CPSC210 Personal Project 

After studying for a long time, I finished this project
First of all, I want to pay tribute to the predecessors of programmers who develop tools such as Eclipse and Idea. They have guided us along the way, and they have made the complexity simple, so that everyone has opportunity to programming.
I developed a Java IDE. Of course, the functions of this IDE are still extremely weak compared to the existing mature commercial IDEs, but this IDE still conforms to the basic functions that an IDE should have: project management, editing, compilation and running. It's even enough to compile itself


**This IDE (v2) has the following functions**
- Manage a program formed by several classes with multiple levels and multiple package names on a project basis
- Use dictionary files that can be edited by yourself to convert codes using keywords in other languages into standard English-based Java files, or redefine a keyword
- Compile the entire project, and then run the specified class in a specified package
- Cross plantform support in Windows and Linux

**Due to limited time, some methods are not reflected in the UI in the program**
- Dictionary management
- Creat Project

**Listed function is in the plan of further development**
- High-Light key word
- A more useful editor
- More user-friendly UI
- Change information of project
